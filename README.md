# Avatar-Generation-from-Real-Images-using-Deep-Learning

Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to develop a deep learning-based system for generating personalized avatar images from real photographs. This system will leverage state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to create visually appealing and recognizable avatars with artistic qualities.

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:
You'll need a dataset of real images for this project. A popular choice is the CelebA dataset, which contains images of celebrities. You can download it from the internet and then upload it to Google Colab.

2. Model Architecture:
Design and implement a deep neural network architecture capable of transforming real images into avatar-style images.You can use a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) architecture to create your avatars.

3. Training: Train the model on the prepared dataset using appropriate loss functions and optimization techniques. Fine-tune the model to generate avatars that maintain the facial features and unique characteristics of the input images.

4. Training: Train the model on the prepared dataset using appropriate loss functions and optimization techniques. Fine-tune the model to generate avatars that maintain the facial features and unique characteristics of the input images.

5. Evaluation and Saving
Evaluate the model and save the trained weights.
